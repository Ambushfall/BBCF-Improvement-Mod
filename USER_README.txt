BBCF Improvement Mod (v3.00) by KoviDomi -- README
==========================

What this mod provides
==========================
Unlocks the game's region restricted multiplayer.
Adds extra game modes.
Adds hitbox overlay.
Create custom palettes and effects.
Manage and load custom palettes without file modifications.
See each other's custom palettes in online matches.
Options to improve the performance of the game even further.
More flexibility to change the graphics options.
Change avatars and accessories in online rooms/lobbies without going back into menu.
Freely adjustable ingame currency value.

Where to place your custom palette files (.hpl)
==========================
- The palette folders are created in the path "..\BlazBlue Centralfiction\BBCF_IM\Palettes\" upon the first launch of the mod.
- Place your .hpl files into the character's corresponding palette folder (at "..\BlazBlue Centralfiction\BBCF_IM\Palettes\") to have the mod automatically load them upon start, and making them selectable ingame via the mod's menu.
- Effect files must end with the naming convention of "_effectXX.hpl". Where XX is the index of the effect file. 
For example, if you have a custom palette file named "Nyx_Izanami.hpl", then in the same palette folder a file named "Nyx_Izanami_effect01.hpl" will be loaded as that palette's first effect, and a file named "Nyx_Izanami_effect06.hpl" will be loaded as sixth, etc.
- A file created with name ending "_effectbloom.hpl" will turn on the bloom effect for that custom palette in the game. (Once activated, the bloom effect will keep the color it was first activated on, and can't be changed unless a new round is started)

Requirements
==============
The game must be up-to-date

How to install
==========================
1. Download and extract the latest BBCF_IM.zip
2. Put dinput8.dll and settings.ini into the game's folder (where BBCF.exe is located)
(Should be at "..\Steam\SteamApps\common\BlazBlue Centralfiction")
3. Adjust the values in settings.ini as desired

Uninstall
==========================
Delete or rename dinput8.dll. The mod makes no permanent changes to anything.

Known issues
==========================
Platinum keeps swapping between her default and the selected custom palette. To prevent this select the palette before the match starts, and do not change it during match.

Troubleshooting
==========================
First make sure that your issue doesn't persist if you remove/rename dinput8.dll
If the issue still persists, then it has nothing to do with the mod.

1. The mod's UI is very small, unreadable:
This happens if you run the game in windowed or full-window mode with a resolution that's higher than what your monitor supports.
Try changing your display setting to fullscreen, or lowering the resolution ingame.

2. Blackscreen problem:
Make sure that RenderingWidth and RenderingHeight values in the .ini file are correctly set to the resolution of your game. 
If their values are higher than your monitor's native resolution, then you will get blackscreen.

3. Game crashes when launched:
Make sure that the settings.ini file is present in the game's folder.
Check if the problem still occurs after you remove, or rename dinput8.dll
Turn off tools such as MSI Afterburner, Plays.tv, or other recording softwares and overlays that manipulate D3D.
Make sure you are running both Steam and the game with administrator privileges, and remove any steam_appid.txt file if present in the game's directory.
Restore the default settings in the settings.ini file.
Reboot your system.

Keep in mind that the mod may partially, or completely stop working whenever a new official patch of the game is released. (Though unlikely)
